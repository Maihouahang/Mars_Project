# Mars_Project

For this project, I am doing a full web-scraping and data analysis project. I will be identifying HTML elements on a page, identifying their id and class attributes, and using this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I will also scrape various types of information, for example: HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
